**Taints and Tolerations are powerful scheduling tools in Kubernetes. They control which pods can be scheduled on which nodes.**

What is a Taint?
A taint is applied to a node and tells Kubernetes:
- “Don’t schedule any pods here unless they can tolerate this taint.”

<pre><code>
#kubectl taint nodes node-name key=value:effect
</code></pre>

What is a Toleration?
A toleration is added to a pod to say:
- “I can handle this taint, so it’s okay to put me on that node.”
