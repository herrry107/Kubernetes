Kubernetes Ingress is a powerful and flexible way to manage external access to services running inside a Kubernetes cluster, typically over HTTP and HTTPS.

**In simple terms:**
An Ingress acts like a smart router that sits at the edge of your Kubernetes cluster and routes traffic from the outside world to your services based on rules you define.
